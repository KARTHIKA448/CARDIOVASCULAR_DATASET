Cardiovascular disease occurrence - 
        This is a target variable which provides the information about the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease. In the 'cardio' column, the value '0' means absence of cardiovascular disease and '1' means presence of cardiovascular disease. The name of this 'cardio' column should be changed into 'cvd' for better understanding. In this dataset, near about half of the subjects have cardiovascular diseases.
