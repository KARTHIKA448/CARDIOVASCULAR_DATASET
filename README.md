Cardiovascular disease occurrence - 
        This is a target variable which provides the information about the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease. In the 'cardio' column, the value '0' means absence of cardiovascular disease and '1' means presence of cardiovascular disease. The name of this 'cardio' column should be changed into 'cvd' for better understanding. In this dataset, near about half of the subjects have cardiovascular diseases.

ABOUT THE FEATURES:
The "CARDIOVASCULAR_DATASET" dataset includes features such as id,age, gender, height, weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and cardiovascular disease presence or absence. It also includes indicators like 'ap_hi', 'ap_lo', 'cholesterol', 'gluc','smoke', 'alco', 'active', and 'cardio', which help identify potential health issues.

CONCLUSION:
The dataset shows that about half of the subjects have cardiovascular diseases, with most being women. The majority of patients have normal cholesterol and glucose levels, with a small percentage of outliers. The majority do not consume alcohol, and regular physical activity is low. However, 48% of patients suffer from cardiovascular disease, and 51% do not have it. The majority of patients have normal weight, but 64.14% have heavy weight, which could potentially cause cardiovascular disease.
